2. **Click on an EnviroLink post** to view single page
   - Scroll to the bottom of the article content
   - You should see the full attribution box

3. **If nothing shows:**
   - Make sure you're viewing a post created BY the EnviroLink plugin
   - Check that the post has metadata (see troubleshooting below)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Nothing displays on listing pages

**Possible causes:**
1. Blocksy hook isn't working on your version
2. Posts don't have metadata

**Solution A - Try Alternative Hook:**

In your functions.php, find this section:
```php
// PART 3: Alternative Hook (if above doesn't work)
```

UNCOMMENT the code below it by removing `/*` and `*/` around the function.

**Solution B - Check Blocksy version:**
- Make sure you have Blocksy 2.0+ installed
- Update Blocksy if needed

---

### Problem: Nothing displays on single post pages

**Possible cause:** The post doesn't have EnviroLink metadata

**Check if post has metadata:**

Add this TEMPORARY code to your functions.php:
```php
function envirolink_debug() {
    if (!is_single()) return;

    $post_id = get_the_ID();
    $source = get_post_meta($post_id, 'envirolink_source_name', true);

    echo '<div style="background: yellow; padding: 20px; border: 3px solid red;">';
    echo '<h3>DEBUG:</h3>';
    echo '<p>Post ID: ' . $post_id . '</p>';
    echo '<p>Source: ' . ($source ? $source : 'NOT FOUND') . '</p>';
    echo '</div>';
}
add_action('wp_footer', 'envirolink_debug');
```

View a post. If you see "NOT FOUND", the post has no metadata.

**Why no metadata?**
- Post was created manually (not by plugin)
- Post was created before metadata feature was added
- Metadata extraction is disabled in plugin feed settings

**Fix:** Go to **EnviroLink News ‚Üí RSS Feeds ‚Üí Edit Settings** for your feed and make sure metadata checkboxes are enabled.

---

### Problem: Metadata displays but looks unstyled

**Cause:** CSS wasn't added or isn't loading

**Fix:**
1. Go to Appearance ‚Üí Customize ‚Üí Additional CSS
2. Make sure the CSS is there
3. Try adding `!important` to key styles if needed
4. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
5. Clear WordPress cache if you use a caching plugin

---

### Problem: Metadata shows on ALL posts (not just EnviroLink ones)

**This shouldn't happen** - the code checks for `envirolink_source_name` before displaying.

**If it does happen:**
- Check that you pasted the code correctly
- Make sure the `if (!$source_name) return;` lines are present

---

## Customization

### Change Colors

In the CSS file, find and replace:
- `#2c7a3e` - Main green color (change to your brand color)
- `#f9fafb` - Background color
- `#e5e7eb` - Border color

### Change Position on Single Posts

In functions.php, find this line:
```php
add_action('blocksy:single:content:bottom', 'envirolink_single_metadata', 10);
```

Replace `content:bottom` with:
- `content:top` - Display at top of content
- `title:after` - Display after title
- `featured-image:after` - Display after featured image

### Hide Metadata on Mobile

Add to your CSS:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .envirolink-listing-meta {
        display: none;
    }
}
```

### Change Listing Format

In functions.php, find the `envirolink_listing_metadata()` function.

Current format: `Source ‚Ä¢ Author ‚Ä¢ Date ‚Ä¢ Tag`

To show only source and date:
```php
$metadata_parts = array();

if ($source_name) {
    $metadata_parts[] = '<span class="envirolink-source">' . esc_html($source_name) . '</span>';
}

if ($pubdate) {
    $formatted_date = date('M j, Y', strtotime($pubdate));
    $metadata_parts[] = '<span class="envirolink-date">' . esc_html($formatted_date) . '</span>';
}
```

### Show Only First 2 Tags on Single Posts

In the single post metadata function, find:
```php
foreach ($tag_array as $tag) {
```

Replace with:
```php
foreach (array_slice($tag_array, 0, 2) as $tag) {
```
